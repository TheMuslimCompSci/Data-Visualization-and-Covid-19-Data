# Data-Visualization-and-Covid-19-Data
The HCC research group is working the SCRC to develop solutions to support research into Covid-19. We are proposing a project to support the development of visualization of ensemble data generated by modelling algorithms. The project can be developed using either Python or Javascript. Based on the programming language chosen appropriate graphics libraries will be used.

To launch the application via the terminal, navigate to the src/main/main.py file and enter the command: python main.py. If your machine has both python 2 and 3 installed, enter: python3 main.py. You may be prompted to install the following python packages: tkinter, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn. To install any of these, enter the command: pip install <package>. For example: pip install numpy. To launch the application via an IDE/editor, simply run the main.py file.
