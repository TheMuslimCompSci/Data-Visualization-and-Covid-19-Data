# Data-Visualization-and-Covid-19-Data
The HCC research group is working the SCRC to develop solutions to support research into Covid-19. We are proposing a project to support the development of visualization of ensemble data generated by modelling algorithms. The project can be developed using either Python or Javascript. Based on the programming language chosen appropriate graphics libraries will be used.
